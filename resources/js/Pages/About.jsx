                    Welcome to <span className="font-semibold">KonstruKalakal</span> ‚Äî your trusted
                    platform for browsing, trading, and donating construction materials.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
                    We built KonstruKalakal with a simple mission: to reduce waste, save costs, and
                    support communities by giving unused or surplus construction materials a second
                    life. Whether you‚Äôre a builder, contractor, architect, or simply someone with
                    leftover materials at home, our platform makes it easy to connect with others who
                    can use them.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-500">Our Purpose</h2>
                <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    Every year, tons of construction materials go unused or end up in landfills.
                    KonstruKalakal aims to change that. By creating a digital space for responsible
                    trading and donations, we promote sustainability, affordability, and
                    collaboration within the construction industry.
                </p>
